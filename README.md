ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Francisco Santos!

ðŸš€ I am a Network Engineer specializing in automation and the development of network-related tools. 
In my previous role, I developed a full-stack web application using Laravel and PostgreSQL. 
This application utilized the VMware Velocloud SD-WAN API to provide real-time data and troubleshooting capabilities. 
It served as a Source of Truth for static routes, circuits, DNS, PPOE logins, path selection, segments, builds by region/site/country, event logging and much more! 
The application also included features for triggering webhooks to perform tasks such as checking for duplex mismatches. Despite the lack of documentation from VMware, I reverse-engineered the flow from the Velocloud Orchestrator. 
Additionally, the tool could generate reports to identify data inconsistencies, such as circuit costs in a specific region or the percentage of builds on newer versions. While I can't share the code due to it being an internal product, I can provide censored screenshots of the application.

ðŸ’»  Although I work in IT and have a deep passion for technology, I spend most of my free time working on my car and attending Cars & Coffees events.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently focused on improving my NetDevOps skill set, particularly with pipelines!
